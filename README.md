Pact coffee delivery freshly roasted coffee by post.

Context
---
As a business we acquire new customers from marketing channels,
We incentivise a new customers first bag of coffee because we know our coffee is incredible
We have a range of incentives to entice new customers

*This is a high level overview to set the context for this test*

Your task
----
Fix and refactor the codebase. Make the specs green and ensure that it's working as expected.
Use the integration spec to guide you through.

The test itself is pretty straight forward but your solution will require you to make design and product decisions.

We expect:
- clean code
- a commit history (so we can understand your thought process)
- green specs
 
If you have some spare time, describe and add a new voucher of your choice.

Good Luck!
